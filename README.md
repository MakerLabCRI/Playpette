Gamified Pipette: Revolutionizing Biology Education
In many schools, theoretical knowledge is predominantly taught within classrooms, leaving practical laboratory skills in subjects like biology and chemistry often underemphasized. Unfortunately, limited resources and high costs prevent most high schools from establishing fully equipped labs. Through interviews with high school students, we discovered that even during lab classes, they seldom have the opportunity to use a pipetteâ€”a crucial instrument in carrying out experiments. Furthermore, they found the process of integrating theory and practice monotonous, causing them to overlook important details.

Addressing these challenges, our project aims to create a gamified and user-friendly pipette specifically designed for beginners in the classroom.

Understanding that pipettes are commonly used in laboratories, we recognize their expensive nature and susceptibility to damage when mishandled by novices. By transforming the use of a pipette into a game-like experience reminiscent of using a controller, learners will become familiar with the instrument's usage guidelines and precautions without even realizing they are studying.

By introducing this innovative educational tool, our goal is to bring high-quality education and enjoyable learning experiences into the classroom, inspire creativity, and simplify biology education for a wider audience.
